# Instacart-basket
Data analysis project using Python for existing company Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. For purpose of this project fictive data about customers was added.

## Objective
Instacart already had very good sales, but they wanted to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data was required in order
to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria with targeted marketing strategy. Management team wanted to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products.

## Data
Data includes over 3 million rows of open-source real data about Instacart's 
 * orders
